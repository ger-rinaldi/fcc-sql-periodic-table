# Salon Appointment Manager Project

Welcome to my Periodic Table project! This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in both BASH scripting and PostgreSQL database management by correcting schemas and data within the database and elaborating a script that queries relevant information from it. It also put's to test the git acquired knowledge from previous courses/tutorials.

## Description

This project focuses on understanding SQL datatypes and correcting the already existing schemas, creating a Bash script that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve some data and GIT usage.

As the previous project (Salon Appointment Management) I decided to create a local repo to keep track of changes, so that the history of changes can be accessed to keep better track of the project's progress, which is not the same repository used in CodeAlly's VM. That's why almost no commit will deal with fixes and refactoring.

## Abilities and Concepts Demonstrated

- Database Creation: Set up a new PostgreSQL database to store data.
- Data Insertion: Insert data into the database tables using SQL INSERT statements.
- Relationships: Establish relationships between tables using foreing keys.
- Constraints and Validation: Implement various constraints like UNIQUE and NOT NULL for data validation and integrity.
- Querying: Craft required queries to retrieve relevant information from the database.
- BASH scripting: Develop a BASH script to interact with the database when executed.

## Achievement

This project allowed me to gain insights into PostgreSQL and practice basic SQL queries and operations and at the same time reinforce my algorithmic and problem solving skill by using BASH to interact with the database.
